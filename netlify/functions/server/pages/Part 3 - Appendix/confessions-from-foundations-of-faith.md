1. Freedom
   If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. (John 8:31-32)

Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. (John 17:17)

I desire to receive the word of God by His grace, not by my own righteousness. I refuse legalistic mindsets and judging attitudes in the name of Jesus.
I don't approach the word of God by moral standards. I see and understand the Bible through the eyes of the gospel.
I don't interpret the Bible based on my experience, worldly theories or knowledge. I refuse to place these things above the authority of the word of God.
I believe that the truth sets me free as I speak, think, and act according to the word of God.

Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. (Revelation 1:5-6)

2. Statement Of Faith
   Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. (Matthew 16:16)

But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. (John 1:12)

Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. (Ephesians 2:5-6)

I was born again by receiving Christ. I have been seated in places of authority in Christ Jesus. I hereby declare that I see all circumstances through the Word, and I reign over them by proclaiming in faith.

3. Who Is A Christian?
   One Who Functions As A New Creation
   Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature： old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. (2 Corinthians 5:17)

One Who Lives By The Life Of God
And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. (1 John 5:11-12)

One Who Has Overcome The World And Who Reigns In The World
Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them： because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. (John 4:4)

One Who Lives By Faith
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature： old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. (2 Corinthians 5:17)

And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. (Luke 17:6)

One Who Has Been Made Righteous By The Righteousness Of God
Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus (Romans 3:24)

Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. (Romans 4:25)

For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. (Romans 5:17)

As a Christian, I have eternal life. This ZOE life is a life-giving spirit. Therefore, no sickness can dwell in my body. When I encounter circumstances that I do not approve, I change them by proclaiming in faith.

As a Christian, I am superior to Satan.

I have faith. I am righteous. Righteousness is my nature. I can always stand in the presence of God without any guilt or inferiority regardless of what I have done. I have grace to do everything excellently. As a bona-fide child of God, I reign over all circumstances as Jesus did on earth.
I am the righteousness of God.
I am the trophy of God’s goodness.

4. Prayer
   And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it. (John 14:13-14)

If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. (John 15:7)

Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain： that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John 15:16)

God has chosen me and ordained me so that He can answer my prayer. I ask for what I need today in prayer in the name of Jesus according to the word of God. I believe I have already received what I have asked for. My prayers are always answered because God is faithful.

5. Guidance Of The Holy Spirit
   But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. (John 14:26)

My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me (John 10:27)

For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. (Romans 8:14)

I hear the voice of the Lord because I'm His sheep. As the Lord abides in me, He guides me in various ways in everything that I trust Him with. I enjoy the abundant life of Christians by committing more of my life to His guidance.

6. Fundamental Doctrine I
   All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16)

Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. (1 John 4:4)

Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. (James 4:7)

I believe in the sovereignty of God who reigns over the universe and in the redemption of Jesus Christ. I rely on the Holy Spirit who is still living, working, and helping me.
I believe all Scripture is written by inspiration of God and is unchanging truth. I proclaim that I will think, speak and live according to the word of truth.
I know that Satan is a disarmed enemy. I confront his deceptions with the word of God and always triumph. I declare all stealing and destroying works of the enemy illegal.

7. Fundamental Doctrine II
   But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. (Acts 1:8)

I believe that there is no coincidence for Christians. Therefore, I give full measure to worship, accomplish the will of God in all encounters and incidents, and live every moment to the best of my ability.
I do not get caught up in men's praise or criticism since the Lord knows everything about me. Instead, I am conscious of Him who reigns over the universe and only desire His acknowledgements.
I am a spirit, I have a soul, and I live in a body. I am a weapon of righteousness. My soul submits to my spirit and my flesh submits to my renewed soul as I confess the Word.
As a Christian, I no longer live for myself, but I have set my life’s pilgrimage for the glory of God, the benefits of others, and the spread of the gospel.

8. God’s Character
   The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. (John 10:10)

God is good and the devil is bad. I believe in His goodness, mightiness, and righteousness. He faithfully works according to His promise whenever I get hold of His word.
I joyfully obey the Word of God today because I believe that God is love and that He always gives me freedom.

God is the same yesterday, today and forever and He does not look at men's appearance. He works for me in the same way as He did for the righteous men of both the Old and New Testament when I get hold of all the words He has given to them.

9. Nine Gifts Of The Holy Spirit
   Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. (1 Corinthians 12:4-7)

But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way. (1 Corinthians 12:31)

I eagerly desire the gifts of the Holy Spirit today. I desire the word of knowledge, the word of wisdom, discerning of spirits, the gifts of healing, faith, the working of miracles, divers kinds of tongues, prophecy, the interpretation of tongues to be manifested in my life, in my cell and in my church in such abundance that we may become powerful Christians and a powerful church.

10. Faith
    So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God (Romans 10:17)

But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. (Hebrews 11:6)

For we walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7)

Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. (Hebrews 10:38)

I seek and enjoy the blessings of His promise by faith today. Faith comes by hearing the word of God and it works when I confess the word. I live by faith, not by sight. My faith is increasing every day.

11. Spiritual Growth
    “To prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up” (Ephesians 4:12)

"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." (2 Corinthians 3:18)

I am a teachable spirit, who humbly receives the word of God regarding new creation realities, applies the word of righteousness to my life, and grows spiritually every day with patience. I don't stop growing until I come to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. I look intently into the perfect law that gives me freedom. I am being changed from glory to glory by the Holy Spirit. I am a branch who brings forth its fruit in season.

12. The Hope Of His Calling
    “As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.” (John 17:18)

"If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work." (2 Timothy 2:21)

"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful." (1 Corinthians 4:2)

I live in the world, but I am not of the world. I belong to the kingdom of heaven and I shine forth the light of Jesus in the world. I believe the Holy Spirit in me is guiding me to my utmost calling as I faithfully complete the small tasks I am entrusted with. As a pilgrim, I serve Jesus as my Lord and readily obey his voice every day.
