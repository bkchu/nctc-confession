Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. (1 John 4:15)

I confess that Jesus is the Son of God. Therefore, God lives in me. I live in God.

And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. (1 John 4:16)

I know that God loves me. I believe that God loves me. God is love. I live a life of love. I dwell in God and God dwells in me.

There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. (1 John 4:18)

God loves me with a perfect love. I am not afraid that God would do something bad to me. I have conviction that God actually loves me. God loves me so much that He cannot leave me the way I am. I trust God completely. I love God because He first loved me.

The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? (Psalm 27:1)

The Lord is my light and my salvation. Because He is the strength of my life, I am not afraid of anyone. I have overcome the devil. I do not fear men. I am bold as a lion.

What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? (Romans 8:31)

God is on my side. Who could be against me and win? No one. I always win.

He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? (Romans 8:32)

God has already given me the best. God has given me Jesus. I have no lack. I have more than enough to overflowing.

All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. (John 6:37)

Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. (Hebrews 13:5)

I have come before Jesus. Jesus never leaves me. God never abandons me. I trust Jesus completely. Jesus is my source. I do not worry whether I can have enough. I always have more than enough.

That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God. (Ephesians 3:17-19)

I believe Christ lives in me. I have been rooted and grounded in love. I understand and have the love of Christ. The Anointed One lives in me.

Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. (James 4:7)

No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. (Isaiah 54:17)

I am not afraid of the devil. When I resist the devil , he cannot help but flee. Any strategy or tactic of his is useless on me.

Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. (1 John 4:4)

The wisdom of man and the wisdom of the world says that “Life is full of ups and downs,” but even though I live in the world, I am not of the world, so I keep moving upwards and forwards. There is no retreat or retrogression in my life.

I only think progress and success. Failure does not exist in my life. I am more than a conqueror through Christ who causes me to overcome. (Romans 8:37)

Nothing can shake me or change my mind. No situation or person can hinder my success, because success is inside me. Hallelujah!
