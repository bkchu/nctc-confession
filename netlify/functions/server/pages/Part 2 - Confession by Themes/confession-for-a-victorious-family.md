And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. (Matthew 19:5-6)

But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. … For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. (1 Corinthians 11:3, 1 Corinthians 11:8-9)

1. A Wife’s Prayer For Her Husband
   Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. (1 Peter 3:1-2)

Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. (Ephesians 5:22-24)

My husband is the best gift God has given to me. Therefore, I value him and respect him and obey his words gladly.
I am his helper and I always edify and encourage him. As I pray for him. In answer to my prayer, God helps him to continually grow spiritually and to be a success in his life. Everyday, he is becoming a more influential person in the world.

My husband’s wisdom is increasing every day.
His ability and capacity is increasing every day.
He is excellent in all things and is recognized as an excellent person even at his workplace, favored by his superiors, his colleagues and his inferiors.
He makes the right choices every day and never misses out on a good opportunity, utilizing them to continually make progress and is promoted for it.

2. A Husband’s Prayer For His Wife
   Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered. (1 Peter 3:7)

Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; … So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. ... Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband. (Ephesians 5:25, Ephesians 5:28, Ephesians 5:33)

Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. (Proverbs 31:28-30)

I will consider my wife to be a weaker vessel and value her as an heir together with me in the grace of life.
I love my wife as Christ loved and gave himself for the church.
I value and love my wife as if she were my own body.
My wife is full of wisdom and raises our child with wisdom. My wife continually receives the spirit of wisdom and revelation through the Holy Spirit and grows spiritually everyday as a victor in every area of life.

3. A Parent’s Prayer For The Child
   And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man. (Luke 2:52)

And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. (Ephesians 6:4)

Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. (Colossians 3:21)

Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. (Proverbs 22:6)

The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame. Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. (Proverbs 29:15, Proverbs 29:17)

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates. (Deuteronomy 6:5-9)

My child is the best gift God has given me. Even before God formed this child in the mother’s womb, He made my child with a plan.
I am a steward to help my child fulfill the plan God has for his/her life.
My child already has all the talent and abilities needed to move forward and succeed up to his/her highest calling. I teach my child the Word and how to apply the Word in his/her life so that he/she may persevere and be diligent in all things, living by faith.

My child is going to be the best in the area of his/her calling. As my child grows in understanding of God’s Word, the grace given to him/her will increase more and more and he/she will function excellently in all areas of his/her life. In his/her mouth is wisdom, his/her judgments and choices are excellent, and he/she is favored by his/her superiors and colleagues.
The blessings that go out of my mouth regarding my child become a reality in his/her life.
He/she will grow and increase more and more in wisdom and revelation, and he/she will complete every necessary training to be strongly built up like Joseph, who became an abundantly fruitful branch of the vine, expanding the kingdom of God and manifesting God’s glory. Hallelujah!
