Father God, as long as I yield to you, I believe you will work in the situations of my life.
Lord, you are the Lord of my life. Therefore I pray that you will guide me into the best path you have prepared for me today.

I will only meet people whom you have planned for me to meet. I will only listen to the things you have planned for me to listen. I will only say what you want me to say.

I function as your child in the anointing of the Spirit.

I walk in the light in the name of Jesus.

There is no single soul I meet by chance.

Your spirit works in me today in the name of Jesus.

I refuse to fear. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

I refuse to fail, because I am a victor in Jesus Christ. I am more than a conqueror by the name of Jesus.

I thank you that your presence is within me.
Thank you that your spirit of excellence is working in me.

I don’t act or speak foolishly. God’s wisdom protects my spirit and my fellowship with the Spirit generates wise strategies in me.

I treat people through the Holy Spirit. I see the world, situations, and people through the eyes of God.

Thank you Lord. Thank you for every good thing you have granted me in my life. I receive it in the name of Jesus. I am also a giver today. I give blessings in the name of Jesus. People are blessed by me. I am the source of blessings in Christ.

I yield my body to the Lord today. I submit every organ and bone of my body to the Holy Spirit.

I am your living temple today. Lord, please, speak through me, move through me, work through me, and speak in me. I will obey your words.

Divine health is inside me. I refuse any sickness, infirmity, or pain to stay in my body. Every cell in my body is filled up with life of God. I enjoy divine health. Glory to God!

Lord I thank you for the Spirit of understanding and wisdom working in me.
I study your Words today and understand them. When I study your Word, I will understand them. That Word will work in me and I will speak the Word through my mouth constantly. I will speak boldly today about the revelation I have received and the works of God.

All the nations are waiting for me and I am on my way there now. Lord, send me there. The Lord has sent me. I have been sent by the Lord. I have a message for the world to hear, and they will listen. World, wait for me! I am on my way!

For The Family
Lord, thank you for my precious children. Your anointing is upon them. They will live only according to your will. They will only do the works of God. They will live only by your Word. In Jesus name!

No evil power can touch them.

Thank you, Father God. Wisdom is in the mouth of my wife (husband) and in her (his) heart. My wife (husband) is functioning in God today.

For The Employees
I pray for every single one of my employees in the name of Jesus. They will live only according to God’s will and God’s thoughts. In every path they move in, no harm will come upon them. God’s Word is in their heart and in their mouth. In Jesus name!

I begin today full of strength with the Holy Spirit. In Christ, according to his anointing, I can do all things. I am victorious in every situation I meet today. I am moving forward and winning today. I praise the King of glory. Hallelujah!

For My Cell Members
Lord, thank you for our beloved cell family you have sent to me. I bless them and pray for them in Jesus name. Today they will walk with Christ in the Lord. The word alive in them will work in them and as the Holy Spirit guides them and reveals things to them, they will react sensitively and move forward from glory to glory and from strength to strength. They will walk in your best path of blessing which you’ve prepared for them. They will not only receive the best of favor by meeting people you have prepared, but will also become a blessing to everyone they meet. An opportunity to win souls is opening for them. They are growing, being promoted, and moving forward. Everywhere they go God’s anointing is with them, and they will finish today with a victorious testimony in Jesus name.
