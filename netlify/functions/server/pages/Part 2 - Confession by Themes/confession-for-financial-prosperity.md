Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. (Psalm 35:27)

The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. (Proverbs 10:22)

Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the Lord shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. (Zechariah 1:17)

And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: (2 Corinthians 9:8)

The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. (Psalm 34:10)

Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. (Proverbs 3:9-10)

But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. (Philippians 4:19)

If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: (Isaiah 1:19)

The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. (John 10:10)

Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. (1 Corinthians 3:21-23)

Jesus who was prosperous became poor to pay the price to make me prosperous. (2 Corinthians 8:9)
Therefore, I am prosperous. I cannot be poor. I always have more than enough in all things. (2 Corinthians 9:8)
I am a child of the King. This world and all that exists in the universe belongs to my Father. I am his child. (James 1:18)
Success is mine. I’m a success. I’m a child of God. If I am his child, I am also a joint-heir with Christ. My life is full of the glory of his inheritance and prosperity. (Ephesians 1:18)

I know who I am. I am filled with the life of God. I am full of God’s power. Christ lives in me. Hallelujah!
In Christ, I am prosperous. I have no lack in material needs. I know that God the Father, who spared not his own son, wants to give me all things.
I believe that when Jesus paid the price for all our curses on the cross, he paid the price for our poverty, and the blessings of Abraham came upon us.
Jesus who owned the whole world was prosperous, but he paid the price to make us prosperous by becoming poor. Therefore, though a young lion may hunger in lack, for me who depends on Jesus, I believe that I have all things in abundance and that there is no lack for me.
Because I obey God’s Word with a joyful heart, I thank God that he not only fills me with the beautiful fruit of the land, but he also fills me with all that I need according to the glory of his riches.
God always gives me in abundance in all things that I lack nothing in every good work.
I will not use the indescribable abundance he gives me only for myself; I will use them as tools to expand the kingdom of God and to express love to my neighbors.
I will train myself in the principle of sowing and reaping that I may receive a greater blessing with greater faith, that I may be a blessing to others.
My abundance is always filled to overflowing that I always have more than enough to do all the good works God asks me to do.
I will willingly sow and share the prosperity the Lord has committed unto me when he shows me a need and guides me to fill that need.
