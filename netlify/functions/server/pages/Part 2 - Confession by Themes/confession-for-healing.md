And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee. (Exodus 15:26)

Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's (Psalm 103:1-5)

But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5)

How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. (Acts 10:38)

That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses. (Matthew 8:17)

Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. (1 Peter 2:24)

Lord, I believe in God’s Word that says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Jesus went everywhere teaching the Word and spreading the gospel of the kingdom of God and healed many people’s diseases while living here on this earth.
Because I believe that Jesus is the same even today, I know he wants to heal me when I’m sick.
God’s Word is my life and that Word brings healing to my body. I thank you that the Word has healing power. Father, I will not take my eyes off of your Word. I will plant your Word in the deepest part of my heart and guard it with all diligence.
I thank you that by Christ’s stripes I am healed. I do not live by what I see and I act in faith. I refuse every symptom caused by sickness in Jesus name. Praise the name of the Lord. Jesus, I love you. Thank for healing me and protecting my health.
I refuse any sickness or pain in my body. Such things can no longer stay in my body. I am full of God’s life and power. By the divine health God gives me I live a long and healthy life.
Just as the Lord has promised, Jesus has delivered me from all the curses of sickness. I cast out all the symptoms in my body with the Word of God. ZOE life flows in my body, in my spirit, and in my soul. Therefore, I declare that no sickness can exist in that ZOE life.

The weak parts of my body are being restored. Jesus was whipped and I am healed by believing in that.
