The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise. (Proverbs 11:30)

And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. (Daniel 12:3)

Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. (1 Timothy 2:4)

And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. (Acts 16:31)

Father, we come before you in prayer and in faith in the name of Jesus. Jesus came to save the lost. You want all people to be saved and to know your truth. Therefore, Father, we bring ( ) before you today.

Satan, we bind you in the name of Jesus and cast you out in all that you are doing in ( )’s life.

We ask that the Father, the Lord of the harvest will send a trustworthy worker to ( ) to share the gospel in a special way for him/her to hear the gospel and understand. As your servant serves him/her, he/she will understand the gospel and will become free of the devil’s hold on him and will serve Jesus to be the Lord of his/her life.

Your word says that you will save those who we pray for. We stand upon the Word from this moment on. Father, we thank you for his/her salvation.

We commit this work into the Father’s hands. We see in faith that ( ) is saved, filled with the Holy Spirit, and full of the Word. Amen. Hallelujah!

Pray this prayer everyday and thank the Lord that he/she is saved. Rejoice. Praise God for this victory. Thank Him that Satan is bound. Hallelujah!
