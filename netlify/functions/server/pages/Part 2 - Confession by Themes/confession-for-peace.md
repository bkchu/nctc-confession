Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. (John 14:27)

Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. (Philippians 4:6-7)

For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. (Romans 14:17)

Lord, I love your Word. You said that to those who love your Word there is no obstacle and there is great peace. That peace has been poured into us through the Holy Spirit and that peace is not like the peace that the world gives. Therefore, I have no need to be worried or afraid.

I am anxious for nothing, but in everything, with prayer and supplication, I make my requests known unto the Father with thanksgiving. I am thankful that when I do so, the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will protect my heart and my mind in Christ Jesus.
Praise the Lord. You said that your kingdom is not eating and drinking, but only righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. Father, continually fill me with your Holy Spirit. I bear more fruits of peace, which is a fruit of the Spirit, in all my relationships with people.
The peace the Lord has given inside me is not given by the world, and therefore, the world cannot take it away from me. Because the Lord leads me from peace to peace, as I am strongly rooted, the peace I enjoy from the inside increases more and more. I always have peace inside me.
