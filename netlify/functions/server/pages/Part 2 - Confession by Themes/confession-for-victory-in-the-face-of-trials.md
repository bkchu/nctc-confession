He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. (Psalm 23:3)

And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; And patience, experience; and experience, hope: (Romans 5:3-4)

No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. (Isaiah 54:17)

For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. (1 John 5:4)

There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. (1 Corinthians 10:13)

For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. (2 Corinthians 4:17-18)

And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. (Romans 8:28)

The Lord is my shepherd and therefore, I have no lack. I rejoice when I meet tribulation because I believe that this tribulation will give me patience, and patience, experience; and that experience will enable me to fulfill my hope. (Romans 5:3-4)

No weapon formed against me shall succeed. (Isaiah 54:17)

I have found my way out of trouble. Everyone that is born of God overcomes the world by faith. I am born of God and therefore I overcome the world. (1 John 5:4)

I am more than able to overcome all these things through Him that loved me. I am more than a conqueror. (Romans 8:37)

Because the Lord helps me I do not fear what man may do to me. (Hebrews 13:6)

I stand firm and face the problem. I have the power to be more than able to overcome this situation. God is faithful that he will not allow me to face tests that I cannot handle and makes a way out for me in the face of difficulty to be more than able to handle any situation.

Through the light affliction I experience, I am achieving a spiritual and eternal weight of glory. This trial will only become a stepping stone for me to achieve greater success. I know for sure that all things work together for those who love God and are called according to His purpose.
