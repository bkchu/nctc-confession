Hallelujah! Praise Jesus Christ, who achieved everything and gave us His authority and power so that we could reign in every situation and live a victorious life.

Living a life of faith, partnering with the Holy Spirit as a child of the Father, and serving Jesus Christ as Lord is truly an amazing life.

The moment we accept the gospel and are born again with this new life, our spirit has become a new man. However, because our mind, emotion, and will, which belong to the soul, have not been renewed, we must renew them through God’s Word and continually train our born again spirit by functioning in faith according to the Word. Only then can we gradually develop spiritually and fully reign in this new life as a king.

Praying in tongues, meditating on the word (confession), the attitude of putting God’s Word as your highest priority, and training to immediately obey the voice of our born again spirit is the shortcut that allow us to develop our born again spirit and reign in every situation.

As I have been in ministry for decades, I see that even though people might know much scripture, if they do not confess with their mouth the Word they believe, they experience very slow positive changes and weak manifestations. On the other hand, I have also seen that no matter how bad the mental problem, if a person receives God’s Word as truth and repeatedly confesses it, he or she can be completely restored from a hopeless situation, built up to be an ambassador for God’s kingdom.

Confessing the Word is not just a method you see on the outside. This is the spiritual principle of how Jesus manifested in the natural realm what he already achieved in the spiritual realm, and is a power and privilege that only New Creation born-again Christians can have.

Now I have a few necessary words to share with you about how to utilize “The New Creation Confession Book” more effectively.

- Confess with a strong and bold heart. If you are saying that ‘There is nothing I can do about this situation or circumstance. I have no hope but God’s compassion,’ this kind of attitude is from the Old Testament, and is not the attitude that allows you to reign as a king as a joint-heir with Christ. Remember that before God told Joshua “Let not the Word to depart from your mouth that you may keep and do all that is written therein,” God first told him to “Be strong and courageous.” Have strength from the heart just as David had when he went out to fight Goliath.

- Be conscious of what the bible says about who you are in Christ, what you have in Christ, and what you can do in Christ as you confess as a born-again New Creation.

- When you confess, it is good to not just say it with your mouth, but to put your heart and emotion in to it, confessing as loud as you can.

- If there is a scripture that touches your heart or if you think it to be important to you at this moment, confess those scriptures repeatedly several times with gusto, praying in tongues intermittently, having the anointing overflow from your spirit.

- If you want to build a bold attitude before you confess, confess “I Change Situations and Always Win,” “I Am the Prophet of My Life,” and “Christ In Me” first.

- Always confess “The New Creation Confession” first, and then confess from “Confession by Themes,” picking a prayer theme that applies to the problem you are facing now.

- It is always good to praise and worship God, to thank Him, and to pray in tongues in between your confession. Every confession seeks the manifestations of the Holy Spirit who works according to the Word of God.

When we confess the Word with faith, we first receive revelation in our hearts, coming to understand and believe the Word. When this happens, you will find that even if we do not work hard and try, the Word we confessed becomes the power within us, producing whatever it has talked about. Then the situation will change, or the wisdom to change the situation will follow. This is because the more we look at the Word, the more the glory of the Word is at work in us.

But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD

2 Corinthians 3:18

God has already prepared all good things in the spiritual realm and He has given us the authority and responsibility to execute them here on this earth.

We must each reign in all situations regarding each of our lives, gradually increasing in influence, winning souls, and expanding God’s kingdom as soldiers for God’s kingdom. Hallelujah!

Looking forward to the march of a great army fulfilling God’s will here on this earth…
