I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. (Philippians 4:13)

I have been crucified with Christ. Yet, I still live. Now it is no longer I that live but Christ living in me. The life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. (Galatians 2:20)

My inner man is made strong by the spirit of the Father and his power. Christ dwells in my heart through faith. I am firmly rooted and grounded in love. I desire to know and possess the width and length, the height and depth of Christ’s love. I know beyond mere head knowledge how much Christ loves me. I am filled with the fullness of God. My body is filled and overflowing with God. His presence is always with me in utmost abundance. (Ephesians 3:16-19)

There is no darkness in my body and it is full of light. God is light. My body is full of the nature and power of God. (Luke 11:36, 1 John 5:1)

Because Christ lives in my body, I am filled with the fullness of the Godhead bodily. (Colossians 2:9-10)

Christ lives in me. Christ is my hope of glory. Christ is the glory that I can see and anticipate. (Colossians 1:27)

I am God’s son. I can call my heavenly Father, “Abba, Father,” because he has given me the Spirit of his Son. Christ in me prays, “Abba, Father! All things are possible for you.” (Galatians 4:6, Mark 14:36)

I have the same glory God the Father has given Jesus. That glory speaks that “I and the Father are one.” I am one with God. (John 10:30)

Christ lives in me. I am one with Christ. I am one with the Father. (John 10:30)

My Father works through Christ living in me. Through this the world knows that the Father has sent Christ to live in me. Through this, the world knows that the Father loves me the same way he loved Jesus. (John 17:23)

Christ, the Anointed One, lives in my body. The Father lives in me. I am one with the Father. (John 10:30)
