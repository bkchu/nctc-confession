1. I Believe In The Power Of The Word.
   So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed. (Acts 19:20)

And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. (Acts 20:32)

It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. (John 6:63)

I was born of the Word.
When the Word of God prevails in my spirit, my ability increases and my life is changed.
The Word of God is able to build me up and give me an inheritance in Christ Jesus.
When I hear the Word and proclaim it, that Word works in my spirit and builds me up and my ability is increased and my life is changed.
As I receive the word, I am being prepared for greater success.
Everything I ask for I receive. I win many souls and I bear much fruit.

2. I Am Conscious Of What’s Inside Me.
   And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. (1 John 5:11-13)

I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. (Philippians 4:13)

Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. (John 16:13)

I am conscious of the life inside me.
I have eternal life. Eternal life is the life of God and this eternal life was given inside of me when I accepted Jesus.
This ZOE life fills my spirit
This ZOE life fills my soul.
This ZOE life fills my body. This eternal life is a life-giving spirit. No sickness can stay in my body.
I live a supernatural life.
I have Christ consciousness.
I am one with Christ.
I no longer live by my own ability. I live by Christ’s ability in me. I can do anything with this ability. My excellence is his ability.
I am conscious of the Holy Spirit. He lives in me.
The Holy Spirit teaches me, leads me into all truth, and instructs me. When I receive his instruction and become transformed, I always win.
I am conscious of the Holy Spirit.

3. I’m A Soul-Winner.
   For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16)

For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. (Romans 1:16)

The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. (John 10:10)

And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. (Matt 28:18-20)

I’m a soul-winner. God so loved the world that he sent His only begotten Son as a soul-winner.
Jesus loved souls that He gave His life to save those souls. I also love God and love souls and therefore I win souls. I’m a soul-winner.
Soul-winning is an act of love. Soul-winning is an act of faith. I am a soul-winner.
I look at one soul with the eyes of the Lord and pray for him or her and share the gospel. The price for that soul has already been paid and there is power to save in the gospel I preach. As long as he accepts the gospel, I know he can come into a victorious and beautiful life. His life shall be like the rising son, shining brighter and brighter unto a perfect day.
I win souls anytime and anywhere. I’m a soul-winner. Soul-winning is my reason for life. It is my life’s direction. I’m a soul-winner.
