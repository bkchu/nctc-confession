“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)

“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.” (1 Peter 1:23)

“Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” (James 1:18)

“I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.” (Galatians 2:20)

“For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.” (Galatians 3:26-27)

“Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.” (Colossians 1:13)

“For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.” (Romans 5:17)

“For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.” (2 Corinthians 4:16)

I was born again from heaven by receiving Jesus into my heart. He has delivered me from the power of darkness, and has translated me into the kingdom of his dear Son. I was crucified with Christ but now I am quickened together with Christ and I sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. His authority is my authority.
It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. I have put on Christ. I have become a new creation;
not partly changed but completely renewed in the realm of the spirit. I function in the realm of the Spirit and in the realm of the Word as a new creation.
I have the nature of Christ. I have the love of Christ. I have the power of Christ. I can change things through my new nature when I think, speak and act according to the Word.
Now I am never frustrated by things or circumstances in the world, but I walk according to the Word of God to reign in life by Jesus Christ. I am never frustrated. Though my outward man perishes, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. I change from glory to glory and power above power.
I am a new creation born again with his divine life and nature.
