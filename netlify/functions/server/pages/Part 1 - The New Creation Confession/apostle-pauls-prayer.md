## The Prayer For Revelation

I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto me the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: The eyes of my understanding being enlightened; that I may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards me who believes, according to the working of his mighty power (Ephesians 1:17-19).

## The Prayer For Power

I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen me with power through his Spirit in my inner being, so that Christ may dwell in my heart through faith. And I pray that I, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and how long and how high and how deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge that I may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God (Ephesians 3:16-19).

## The Prayer For Fruit

I pray that God would fill me with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding. And I pray this in order that I may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that I may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified me to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light (Colossians 1:9-12).

## The Prayer Of Soul Winners

I pray that my love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; That I may approve things that are excellent; that I may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God (Philippians 1:9-11).
