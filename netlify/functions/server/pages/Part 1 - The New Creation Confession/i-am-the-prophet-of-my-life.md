God is not the only one determining my blessing and curse. God has given me the power to choose my own destiny.
I change the course of my life with my mouth.

This book of the law [the Word about who I am in Christ, what I have in Christ, and what I can do] shall not depart from thy mouth, and thou shalt meditate therein day and night and thou shalt keep all that is recorded therein; then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and thou shalt have good success. (Joshua 1:8)

I am getting healthier everyday.
I am succeed more and more everyday.
I am getting stronger everyday.
I am growing in knowledge, understanding, and wisdom everyday.
God’s ability is at work in me, and therefore, I cannot fail.
I am a success.
God’s hand is upon my life, and I move forward and make progress.
God’s ability is inside me.
The ability of the spirit is at work in me.
I see my future with anticipation because I have a great future ahead of me.
I see that all things are changing for the best.
I surely believe that what God has spoken about me in his Word, will all come true. Therefore, I glorify God by being unshakable in the Word and strengthened in faith.
My health is improving.
My finances are increasing.
I am making progress.
I see prosperity.
I see my promotion.
Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world.
I have the power of God working in me.
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
The anointing of the Holy Spirit is upon me, making me to progress further.
I am getting better, stronger, and bigger everyday.
I walk in the victory in Christ Jesus’ name.
Glory to God.
