“They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.” (John 17:16-18)

“But ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.” (Hebrews 12:22-24)

“Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.” (Romans 8:37)

“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;.” (1 Peter 2:9)

I know who I am in Christ.
I am a child of God.
I live in the world but I am not of the world.
I am a citizen of Zion.
Therefore, I live according to the spiritual principles of Zion (John 17:16, Hebrews 12:22).
I am from above.
I live a supernatural life by faith.
Nothing can make me a victim.
I am more than a conqueror who has overcome the world and I reign in this world supernaturally. (Romans 8:37)

Thank you, Jesus. I know who I am.
I am a new creation in Christ. (2 Corinthians 5:17)
I live by life of God, the same life given to Jesus. (1 John 4:17)
You have given me all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through your divine power of Christ on cross. (2 Peter 1:3)
As every place that the sole of my foot treads upon has been given unto me, the promises in your Word are already granted. (Joshua 1:3)

1. I Am A Christian Who Has Eternal Life.
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)

“In him was life; and the life was the light of men.” (John 1:4)

“But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.” (John 20:31)

“And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.” (1 John 5:11)

I have eternal life.
This eternal life is God-kind of life (ZOE), and it has been given to me when I received Jesus.
My spirit is full of ZOE. My soul is full of ZOE. My body is full of ZOE.
ZOE is a life-giving spirit. Therefore, no sickness can stay in my body.
Any infirmity or disease cannot stay in my body.
When I am confronted with things I do not desire, I declare them to change by faith.
When I declare in ZOE, things are subject to change.

2. I Am A Christian Who Has Conquered The Devil.
“Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that by death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage”. (Hebrews 2:14-15)

“Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.” (Colossians 2:14-15)

“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.” (1 John 4:4)

“And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.” (Revelation 12:11)

I have defeated the devil as I am in Christ.
I don’t fear the devil. He cannot do anything to me. Therefore, I always win.
This is because greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world.

3. I Am A Christian Who Has Faith
“For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.” (Romans 12:3)

“For we walk by faith, not by sight:” (2 Corinthians 5:7)

I have faith. It has been given to me when I was born again and it has the power to move mountains. I don’t walk by sight but by faith. I think, speak and act in the realm of faith, therefore I always win. I increase my faith by hearing the Word, and I strengthen my faith by acting on my faith. I reign in the world by faith.

4. I Am A Christian Who Became Righteous By The Righteousness Of God
“But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.” (1 Corinthians 1:30)

“Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:” (Romans 3:24)

“Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Romans 4:25-5:1)

“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21)

I am righteous.
As Christ became my righteousness, I became righteous. I was born again righteous by faith. Righteousness is my nature.
No matter what I have done, I can always stand before the presence of God without any condemnation or inferiority.
My spirit always has the power to do the will of God. I am always bold.
As a righteous man, my prayer always works.
Therefore, I always get my prayers answered.

5. I Am A Christian Who Has The Grace Which Enables Me To Do Anything With Excellence
“But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.” (Ephesians 4:7)

“I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” (Philippians 4:13)

“And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose.” (Romans 8:28)

“But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.” (1 John 2:27)

“He was well known for his intellectual brilliance and spiritual wisdom... He could do anything—interpret dreams, solve mysteries, explain puzzles.” (Daniel 5:12 MSG)

I have grace flowing out from my Spirit, so my life is full of your beauty, favor, charm, and dignity.
Because of the grace, I am favored by my colleagues, friends and my superiors as well as my subordinates. This grace is the power of God to overcome any situation against me. The power of God is working in my spirit.
I can do anything through Christ who strengthens me. God is my power. I am not using human abilities. I have supernatural power. I can do anything.
The anointing is in my soul. The anointing is in my spirit.
I am excellent. Joseph received a spirit of excellence.
Daniel also received a spirit of excellence. I have also received a spirit of excellence. Nothing is impossible.
I have the power of God working inside me.
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, because greater is he that is in me, than he that is in the world.
God is my ability.

6. I Am A Christian Who Is Legally And Legitimately A Son Of God With His Life
“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.” (1 John 3:1-2)

“And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.” (Galatians 4:6)

“Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.” (John 20:17)

I call God Abba Father, because I am his child. God sent his only begotten son to the world so that we can dwell in him.
I reign in the world as Jesus reigned in the world.
I refuse to be sick.
I refuse to fail.
I am more than a conqueror through him that loved me.
I am blessed.
I bring blessings wherever I go.
Jesus brought the eternal life, so I live in the same class as him.
I am an ark of blessing. I live like a king in the world.
As a king has authority in his words, I speak like a king and my words come true.
I’m not an ordinary person.

7. Christians Are The Righteousness Of God.
“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21)

“And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever.” (Isaiah 32:17)

“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.” (1 Peter 2:9)

I am the righteousness of God.
I am the trophy of his goodness.
I am his ambassador.
I am his messenger.
People come to know God through me.
People see his reality through me.
Every part of my life represents the glory of God.
