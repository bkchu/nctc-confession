1. I Have The God-Kind Of Life
The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. (John 10:10)

That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:15-16)

He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. (John 3:36)

I have eternal life. Eternal life is the life of God, and this life was given to me when I received Jesus into my heart.

My spirit is filled with this ZOE life. My soul is filled with this ZOE life. My body is filled with this ZOE life. This ZOE life is a life-giving spirit. Therefore, no sickness can dwell in my body. All weaknesses and diseases cannot stay in my body.

If I meet a situation I do not like, I change my circumstances through proclaiming by faith. When I proclaim in this ZOE life by faith, the circumstances cannot help but change.

2. I Have Righteousness.
Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: (Romans 3:24)

Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. (Romans 4:25)

For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. (2 Corinthians 5:21)

But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: (1 Corinthians 1:30)

And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: (Philippians 3:9)

I am righteous. Christ has become my righteousness, and therefore, I am righteous.
Righteousness is my nature. I can always stand in the presence of God guiltless, and free of self-consciousness, regardless of my actions.
I have in my spirit the ability to always act according to God’s will.
I am always righteous. Therefore, my prayers are always answered.

3. I Have The Remission Of Sins.
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. (Matthew 26:28)

For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. (1 John 3:20)

How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? (Hebrews 9:14)

To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. (Acts 10:43)

My sins have been remitted. I am a righteous man and I am no longer a sinner. If I sin, I confess my sins and quickly step out of condemnation.
My sins have been completely remitted.

4. I Have Salvation, Deliverance, And Freedom.
Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: (Col 1:13)

The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. (Luke 4:18-19)

To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. (Acts 26:18)

I know who I am. I am a child of God. I am a joint-heir with Christ.
Everything in this world must obey to the name of Jesus.
I have won over Satan. Christ has brought me out from the kingdom of darkness and has freed me into the kingdom of his dear Son.
Now the devil has nothing to do with me. Satan cannot manifest in any area of my life.
I declare Satan’s manifestations to be illegal in any area of my life.
“Satan, I command you in the name of Jesus, leave me!”

5. I Have Healing And Divine Health.
But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5)

Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. (1 Peter 2:24)

By Christ’s stripes I am healed. Therefore, I refuse every weakness and sickness in Jesus name. No sickness and stay in my body.
Divine health is our birthright. I am always full of God’s power and God’s life.
I am going to live a long, long healthy life, glorifying God with the divine health God has given me.

6. I Have Peace And Oneness With God.
For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; (Ephesians 2:14-15)

Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. (Romans 5:1-2)

These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.(John 16:33)

Through our Lord Christ Jesus, I have peace with God.
I have become one with God through Christ. Jesus is the head and we are his body. We are members of his flesh and of his bones. (Ephesians 5:30)
As Jesus was on this earth, so am I.

7. I Have Prosperity.
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. (2 Corinthians 8:9)

And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: (2 Corinthians 9:8)

Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;) (2 Corinthians 9:10)

And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. (Genesis 39:2)

And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. (2 Chronicles 20:20)

Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. (Psalm 35:27)

The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. (Proverbs 10:22)

Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the Lord shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. (Zechariah 1:17)

Jesus Christ who was prosperous became poor so that I may become prosperous. Therefore, being born again, I am prosperous.

Prosperity is an authority that belongs to a child of God.
Prosperity is God’s gift.
God gives me the ability, wisdom, and opportunity to obtain wealth.
I have an excellent spirit that best utilizes the wisdom, ability, opportunity, and divine connection God gives me.
As God’s soldier, I use the prosperity God has given me to win souls and to expand God’s kingdom.
I am prosperous.

8. As A Citizen Of Zion, I Have The Authority To Use The Name Of Jesus.
And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. (Matthew 28:18-20)

And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. (Romans 8:17)

For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live. (Ephesians 2:10 AMP)

Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you (John 15:16)

Jesus took back the authority to rule this earth and made me a joint-heir with him to give me that authority.
Whatever I see according to the Word, whatever I believe, and whatever I confess in Jesus name, everything obeys the authority of that name. I am a conqueror reigning with Christ in my life.

9. I Have God’s Agape Love Poured Inside Me And I Can Act In That Love.
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first loved us. (1 John 4:16-19)

And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. (Romans 5:5)

But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; (Matthew 5:44)

Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. (1 Corinthians 13:4-7)

I always act in love with the Holy Spirit inside me who is the spirit of love.
I love my enemies and bless those who curse me. I am kind to those who hate me and by praying for those who mistreat and persecute me, I act according to my heavenly Father’s perfection.

I do not overcome darkness with darkness. Instead, I drive out darkness with light, because I am a child of my Father who is the light. I have that kind of love poured inside me. Therefore, I choose to love with the love of God.
I am patient.
I am meek.
I am not jealous.
I do not brag and I am not proud.
I am not rude.
I do not seek my own profit.
I do not anger.
I do not think evil.
I do not rejoice in evil. I rejoice with the truth.
Because I am a lover, I cover all things with love, I believe all things, I desire all things, and I endure all things.

10. I Have Wisdom.
But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: (1 Corinthians 1:30)

In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power: (Colossians 2:3, Colossians 2:9-10)

And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD (Isaiah 11:2)

Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. (Proverbs 4:7-8)

Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the Lord. (Proverbs 8:33-35)

Jesus became my wisdom and therefore I have greater wisdom than Solomon inside me. Therefore, I always think the right thoughts, say the right things, and make the right choices and actions by the help of the Holy Spirit.
I am not misled. I don’t walk in darkness. I always see with the right perspective and make wise choices and wise actions.
